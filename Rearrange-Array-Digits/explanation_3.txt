The time complexity is less than the required complexity - O(n log(n))
I used Merge Sort to sort the array (since its the fastest algorithm overall)
I found out that in a sorted array the numbers formed by adding alternate numbers for the largest number when added.
Space Complexity is O(n) [Merge Sort's space complexity is linear]
